Rationale,,,
"I reduced costs by adjusting two services. First, I downgraded the RDS instance from db.m3.2xlarge to db.m1.xlarge but kept the read replica, as the application is read-intensive. Second, I reduced the number of EC2 instances from 10 to 6 while maintaining multi-AZ deployment, assuming that 6 instances will handle the load since the system relies more on network performance and caching than compute power. I prioritized services like CloudFront (despite its higher cost) and multi-AZ configurations to ensure availability and a high-quality user experience, which are key factors for a successful system.",,,
